# 🤖 AI Toolbox GSSOC'25 Code of Conduct

## Where Responsible AI Meets Open Collaboration

At **GSSOC (Girl Script Summer of Code) 2025**, we believe code is collaborative, but kindness is non-negotiable. This isn’t just a program—it’s a global community where every **Contributors, Mentors, and Admins** deserves respect, support, and opportunities to grow.

By participating, you agree to foster an inclusive, harassment-free environment—online and offline. Let’s make this journey legendary. 🚀

## 🌟 The GSSOC’25 Pledge

We’re not just coders—we’re builders of a welcome, inclusive, and vibrant open-source universe. Whether you’re a first-time contributor or a seasoned mentor, we pledge to make this journey respectful, empowering, and harassment-free for everyone—regardless of who you are or where you code from.

## 🚀 Our Standards: How We Roll

## ⭐ Behaviors We Love (aka "How to Be a GSSOC Legend")
- The "Noob Whisperer" – Patiently guiding first-timers like they’re the next tech stars (because they are!).
- The Feedback Ninja – Giving suggestions so kindly, they feel like gifts.
- The Credit Fairy – Shouting out contributors like they just won an Oscar. 🏆
- The Open-Door Mentor – Sharing knowledge freely because gatekeeping is so 2005.

## 🚫 Behaviors That Get a Hard Pass
- The "Google It" Ghost – Dismissing questions instead of helping. (We build bridges, not walls.)
- The Keyboard Warrior – Sarcasm, condescension, or harsh tones. (Code fights bugs, not people.)
- The Silent Vanisher – Ghosting on tasks without a word. (A simple "I’m stuck!" saves the day.)
- The Assumption Artist – Judging skills by gender, age, or background. (Surprise! Talent has no labels.)

## ⚖️ Enforcement Responsibilities: Fair & Transparent

How We Handle Issues

- Private Discussion → Minor missteps? Let’s talk 1:1 and learn.
- Public Clarification → If public harm happened, a clear apology resets trust.
- Temporary Timeout → Repeated issues? A break may help.
- Permanent Removal → Harassment, bigotry, or malice? Zero tolerance.

Report concerns. All reports are confidential.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

🌈 Why This Rocks

- Mistakes = Learning – We don’t expect perfection, just a willingness to grow.
- Disagreement ≠ Drama – Debate the code, not the coder.
- Your Voice Matters – See something off? Speak up. We’ve got your back.

(Inspired by the best of open source, but baked with GSSOC’s secret sauce.)

✨ Our Vision

We’re building AI that:
- 🔍 Explains itself (No "magic" algorithms)
- 🌱 Grows responsibly (Sustainable compute practices)
- 🤝 Serves everyone (Not just tech elites)

"The question isn’t whether AI will change the world—it’s who gets to decide how."
